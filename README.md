# C++ DS and Algorithms
Implementations of various data structures adn algorithms in C++ with descriptions of problems.

Hello everyone!

I am Aniruddha Tarodekar, a recent graduate from University of South Florida.
I am passionate about understanding, tackling and solving different problems. 

But in order to do that, one has to be skilled enough to stand at the platform!
I started programming with C->Java->Python and skipped C++.
However, when looking for jobs which have the kind of problems I like tp solve, almost all of them required C++.
So here I am learning and implementing C++ along with its modern features.

Happy coding!
